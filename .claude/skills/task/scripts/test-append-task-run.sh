# Fixture test for append-task-run.sh.
#
# Locks the extractor's contract for the task-run telemetry corpus
# (ai-docs/metrics/task-runs.jsonl). See ai-docs/task-run-schema.md for the
# schema those cases assert against.
#
# The case count is NOT written here. It is derived at the end of the run and
# asserted equal to the design's § Cases row count (that assertion IS AC6), and
# the closing banner prints the derived number. This header previously said
# "Eighteen cases" and was stale within one round -- a transcribed count in a
# comment is a claim nothing checks, which is the same defect AC6 exists to
# catch one layer down.
#
# What this test deliberately does NOT cover:
#   - the /task Step 12 sub-step 5a integration itself. No harness can execute a
#     skill sub-step; its coverage is the AC2 ordering grep plus the Step-12
#     verification block on the schema page.
#   - `instruction_corpus_lines` as a VALUE. It is environment-dependent (it
#     counts the live instruction corpus), so cases assert only that it is
#     present-and-integer where that is meaningful, never a fixed number.
#   - `date` / `branch` / the diff-size trio in case 1, for the same reason. The
#     trio gets its own purpose-built sandbox repo in case 12.
#
# FIXTURE STRATEGY — deliberately different from test-check-citations.sh, which
# mutates a tracked file under a trap triad. The entry point here takes explicit
# path arguments, so every fixture and every append target lives inside a
# `mktemp -d` sandbox and ZERO tracked files are touched. Case 13 asserts that
# property rather than assuming it.
#
# Fixture issue numbers are `#42`, never the real one: check-citations.sh skips
# any `#N` at or below the local PR high-water mark, so a low number keeps this
# file green under that guard.
#
# Usage: bash .claude/skills/task/scripts/test-append-task-run.sh
# Exit 0 = all cases pass. Exit 1 = regression.

# the shipped `File:line` identity key they are two different keys, so the row
# receives NO de-duplication and is counted twice in BOTH counters.
#
# THE OVER-COUNT BELOW IS NOT A BUG. It is measured behaviour, and it is
# expected under the current File:line key. See ai-docs/task-run-schema.md
# § "Counting units" — the frequency clause, the degeneracy signature, and the
# coupling clause all describe exactly this. Do NOT "repair" the parser to make
# the number look right: switching the key to path + Finding text would make
# `.findings_first_seen.minor` read 3, fail this case, and silently change what
# every record in the corpus means MID-SERIES. If this case is red, read the
# schema page before touching anything.

#   stat = c[n - 1]       -> case 18 reds (2 assertions); 15 and 19 stay green
#   mask removed          -> case 19 reds (4 assertions); 15 and 18 stay green
# So each case owns exactly one property and none subsumes another. Note what
# that means for the mask: cases 15 and 18 pass WITHOUT it, because "last cell"
# already absorbs a shift originating in the Finding cell. The mask is what
# handles an escape inside the STATUS cell itself, where the status text is
# split across cells and no single index holds it -- which is the axis rounds 1
# and 2 both left open. If a future edit reds ONE row here, read that row's

# GENUINE delimiter. A single-stage pipe mask matches the second backslash
# together with that pipe, eats the delimiter, and MERGES Finding into Status
# -- so a Finding cell whose prose mentions the objection marker is counted as
# an objection while the row's real status is `✅ Fixed`. The count moves in the
# direction that looks like more review work, and nothing flags it.
#
# Row 1 is the discriminator: prose marker + a trailing `\\` + a real `✅ Fixed`
# status. Row 2 pins that a `\\` NOT adjacent to a delimiter still round-trips.

# nothing, so fixture-side drift (a case added, the banner not updated) was
# invisible and the design-side check ran only when a human typed it at a
# terminal. Both halves are derived now: `cases_run` from the labels emitted by
# this run, `C` from the design's § Cases table.
#
# The registry lives in ai-docs/task-run-schema.md § Cases -- a LIVE page, not a
# frozen plan document, because the coupling is a standing contract rather than
# history. Absent registry == FAIL, deliberately: AC6 IS the coupling, and a
# gate that quietly skips when its reference is missing is the defect this
# assertion was written to remove.
# These paths are $PWD-relative and that is SAFE, not an oversight: the script
# resolves `repo_root` and `cd`s to it at the top (see `set -uo pipefail`
# block), so $PWD is the repo root by the time any assertion runs, and a run
# from outside a work tree exits there rather than reaching this gate. Do not
