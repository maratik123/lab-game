# Append one task-run telemetry record to ai-docs/metrics/task-runs.jsonl.
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
#   /task Step 12 sub-step 5a is the SINGLE writer of the task-run corpus. This
#   script derives one JSON object from the run's progress file plus ambient git
#   facts, and appends it as one line. The corpus exists so an /improve
#   escalation into the instruction corpus can later be shown to have moved, or
#   not moved, the per-task review cost.
#
# WHO RUNS IT
#   /task Step 12 sub-step 5a, once per completed run, before the staging
#   sub-step so the append reaches the PR diff. Nothing else writes this file —
#   not /pr-commented, not /pr-ci-failed, not /main-ci-failed, not
#   /project-review, not /bugfix.
#
# USAGE
#   .claude/skills/task/scripts/append-task-run.sh <progress-file> [<target-jsonl>]
#
#   <target-jsonl> defaults to ai-docs/metrics/task-runs.jsonl and exists so the
#   fixture test can point the append at a sandbox.
#
# EXIT CODES — a PARSE PROBLEM IS NEVER AN ERROR
#   0  appended, full OR degraded (degraded records carry "incomplete": true)
#   2  usage error (no progress-file argument)
#   3  jq not on $PATH
#   4  jq could not compose the record
#   5  could not append to the target
#   Only "cannot append at all" is non-zero. On non-zero, /task Step 12 writes
#   the nine fallback-required fields by hand and continues; under no path does
#   Step 12 halt on this sub-step.
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER
#   - Planning cost. `rounds` counts /task Step 10 self-review rounds ONLY;
#     /interview, design and design-review rounds appear nowhere in the record.
#   - Process and handoff soundness. No field encodes handoff state, so a run
#     whose durable state was never maintained emits a normal-looking line.
#   - Anything after Step 12. Reviewer and CI-fix rounds extend the progress
#     file after this record is written.
#   - The `## Decisions log`. Not parsed in v1, so spec churn during
#     implementation and reopened subtasks are invisible here.
#   The full list, written as open questions, is on ai-docs/task-run-schema.md
#   § "What this log does NOT measure". That page is the schema's home; this
#   header does not restate the field table.
#
# COUNTING UNITS — see the schema page before comparing two records. `findings`,
# `objections` and `objections_reopened` are summed across all rounds and
# therefore inflate with `rounds`; `findings_first_seen` counts only rows absent
# from the immediately preceding round, keyed on the `File:line` cell verbatim.
# That key drifts whenever a Step-11 fix shifts line numbers, which is the
# expected case when several findings share a file. The schema page carries the
# degeneracy signature that tells a measured run from a collapsed one, and the
# coupling clause that binds the field to it.
