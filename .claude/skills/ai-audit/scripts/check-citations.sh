# Citation-namespace guard.
#
# INVARIANT: every citation in the harness must resolve for its reader.
#   A bare `#N` / `PR #N` is repo-relative -> must resolve in THIS repo.
#   This harness was ported from graphite-gp, which had ported it from
#   quartzite, so most inherited citations point at one of those two repos.
#   Such a citation MUST name its namespace (`maratik123/graphite-gp#N`,
#   `maratik123/quartzite#N`, "graphite-gp's `ai-docs/learnings.md` <date>",
#   or a full path under that project's memory namespace).
#
# Run by `/ai-audit` Phase 2 (checklist item P) against the full instruction
# surface. Also runnable standalone: `bash .claude/skills/ai-audit/scripts/check-citations.sh`.
#
# On FAIL: qualify the offending citation with its namespace. NEVER drop a
# citation to make this pass -- dropping destroys verified history and is
# the bug this guard exists to catch, not a valid fix.
#
# Exclusions carried over from the guard's original red test:
#   - ai-docs/learnings.md itself (append-only local log; not a citation site)
#   - ai-docs/bugfix/** (deleted-on-resolution trace files, not durable)
#   - illustrative example filenames matching YYYY-MM-DD-slug.ext (no authority
#     claim -- e.g. a sample spec filename in a template or table row)
#   - already-namespace-qualified forms (naming quartzite or graphite-gp)
#   - scripts/test-*.sh fixture payloads (test data, not citations)
# One additional targeted exclusion added when this guard was promoted:
#   - corrections-log.md's `Superseded by:` field-spec row is FORBIDDEN to
#     touch -- it is a format-spec example
#     illustrating that field's date-ref syntax, not a citation with a real
#     referent. Excluded by matching the ROW'S OWN TEXT within that one file,
#     so any *other* date citation later added to corrections-log.md still
#     gets checked.
#     NOT by line number: this exclusion was originally pinned to
#     `corrections-log.md:47`, an unrelated commit inserted rows above it, and
#     the pin silently re-pointed at a dateless neighbour -- un-excluding the
#     example (guard RED on a clean tree) while appearing to still work.
#     Locked by case 2 of scripts/test-check-citations.sh.
#
# SCOPE -- what this guard does NOT cover, and why. State this openly: a
# silent exclusion reads as "covered everything" when it did not.
#   - ai-docs/plans/**  : frozen historical records. A merged spec/design
#     documents what was decided AT THE TIME; rewriting its references
#     edits history rather than an instruction.
#   - ai-docs/deferred/**: `_inbox.jsonl` is AXIOM-protected -- AGENTS.md
#     § Workflow: "written ONLY by /task Step 12 and /triage. Hand-edits
#     defeat the propagation contract." A guard that fails on a file nobody
#     may hand-edit is a guard that teaches people to ignore it.

  #     mid-sentence and silently swallowed real citations: any prose line

  #     either file still gets checked. NOTE: check (2) deliberately does NOT
  #     use this mechanism -- its line pin drifted and broke (see the header).
  #     These two are NOT safer by nature; they are unrepaired for two
  #     different accidental reasons, neither of which is stability:
  #       - spec-writer.md's pin is INERT. Its specimen ref is below the live
  #         high-water mark, so the LOCAL_MAX test above `continue`s and
  #         execution never reaches this `case`. Its file HAS been edited since
  #         the pin was written; the pin survived only because that edit was
  #         line-count-neutral -- luck, not stability.
  #       - task/reference.md's pin is the only live one, and survives only
  #         because nothing has yet been inserted above it.
  #     Content-address either one the moment it drifts, or preferably before;
  #     do NOT re-pin. Same failure mode as the header's:
  #       spec-writer.md:161    -- a `detail`-field shape demo, quoting a
  #                                specimen ref inside example prose

  #     (Both are described, not spelled: a comment that quotes the bad shape
  #     IS the bad shape, and this script would flag its own source. See
  #     reference.md Checklist P -- "describe the bad shape; spell it only
