# The coverage ratchet: statement coverage may rise freely and may not fall.
#
# ONE IMPLEMENTATION, THREE CALLERS. `.githooks/pre-commit` runs it in raise
# mode, `make cover-ratchet` and CI run it with --check. A second spelling of
# the measurement would let a local run and a CI run disagree about what the
# number is, which is the whole reason the Makefile exists (KD-16).
#
# WHAT IS MEASURED. `go test -coverprofile ./...` over every package, statement
# mode, each package covered by ITS OWN tests — the Go default. Cross-package
# coverage (`-coverpkg=./...`) is deliberately not used: it is slower, and it
# makes a package's number depend on which other packages' tests ran.
#
# ROUNDING. Half-up to hundredths of a percentage point, computed as
# int(p*100 + 0.5)/100 rather than printf "%.2f" — printf rounds half-to-even
# in most awks, and a ratchet should not depend on which awk is installed.
# Float arithmetic throughout; the tolerance absorbs the epsilon.
#
# THE TOLERANCE, AND THE MEASUREMENT UNDER IT. Measured on 8fae04a, ten runs of
# the suite: nine returned 1189/1329 statements = 89.4658%, one returned
# 1191/1329 = 89.6163%. The two statements that flip are timing-dependent:
#   internal/scheduler/execute.go:223.73,225.3
#   internal/scheduler/worker.go:150.21,151.20
# So the observed run-to-run drift is 0.1505 pp. A lucky run RAISES the ratchet
# (that is the rule), after which every ordinary run measures 0.1505 pp lower —
# so a tolerance of exactly 0.15 pp blocks forever, with no code change
# involved. Either raise TOLERANCE_PP to 0.25, or make those two blocks
# deterministic and keep 0.15. This is a one-line decision and it is the
# owner's; the value below is the one the owner specified.
#
# Usage:
#   coverage-ratchet.sh            raise mode: check, and record a new high
#   coverage-ratchet.sh --check    check only: never writes, never stages
#
# Exit 0 = coverage holds (or the ratchet was initialised, or the run was
#          skipped for a named reason printed to stderr).
# Exit 1 = coverage fell past the tolerance, or it could not be measured.
